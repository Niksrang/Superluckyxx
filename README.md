## How to Commit and Push to GitHub

Here are the commands to commit your code and push it to a GitHub repository.

### 1. Initialize Git (only for the first time)
If you haven't already, run this command in your project's terminal:
`git init -b main`

### 2. Stage Your Files
Add all the files to be committed:
`git add .`

### 3. Commit Your Changes
Create a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message:
`git commit -m "Your commit message here"`

### 4. Link to Your GitHub Repository (only for the first time)
Connect your local project to your remote repository on GitHub. **Replace the URL with your own repository's URL.**
`git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`

### 5. Push Your Code to GitHub
Upload your changes:
`git push -u origin main`

After the first push, you'll only need to repeat steps 2, 3, and 5 for future updates.
`git push -u origin main`
